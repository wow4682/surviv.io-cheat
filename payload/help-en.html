	<h3>Survivr Utilities</h3>

	<small>Instructions</small>

	<p>If you can read this, the cheat was loaded correctly.</p>
	<p>Custom keybinds can be set in the 4th tab in the cheat options.</p>
	<p>
		In game you can open the cheat options menu by pressing <span class="highlight_help">escape</span>.
		There are new buttons which control different parts of the cheats and utilities
		Everything is toggled on by default.
	</p>
	<p>If something is not working, make sure you are using Chrome. If the game was just updated and the cheat is not working it means that the extension is broken. You'll need to re-add the source files or update the extension from whatever source you're using.</p>
